## Collaborations
I am eager to collaborate with researchers worldwide. My goal is for our joint research outcomes to be accepted and widely shared.
- **[Westlake University in China, Zhejiang University in China]** I am collaborating with the team of [Prof. Ziqing Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y-nyLGIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) on human-AI collaboration for the medical domain.
- **[Northwestern University in the USA]** I am collaborating with [Yifang Wang (post-doc in Northwestern)](http://wangyifang.top/) and [Prof. Dashun Wang](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/wang_dashun.aspx) on leveraging visualizations to support the domain of Science of Science.
- **[CMU in the USA, ETH Zurich in Switzerland]** I have worked on a paper together with [Adam Perer (an Assistant Professor in CMU)](https://perer.org/) and [Furui Cheng (post-doc in ETH)](https://www.furuicheng.tech/) (Sept 2024).
